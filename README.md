# attendence-system
To provide a streamlined and automated solution to record and manage attendance data for organizations or institutions. The traditional  paperbased attendance management process is often time-consuming,  errorprone, and inefficient. The system should be able to accurately record  the attendance of students, employees, or any other relevant parties, and  store the data securely for easy retrieval and analysis. The system should  also be able to generate reports and provide real-time attendance tracking to enable administrators to make informed decisions. The goal of  the system is to save time and effort for teachers, administrators, and  other personnel who are responsible for attendance management, and to ensure that attendance records are accurate, secure, and up-to-date. The attendance management system project abstract must answer  or address the needs of every issue that happens in the company or  an educational institution. The issues could include difficulty in  tracing employeesâ€™ / students' attendance, managing their working hours/periods they have attended, and preventing the  employees from stealing time/students from giving proxy's. Employee/Student morale is harmed by poor attendance, which  costs businesses overtime and diminishes employee engagement. Poor attendance requires time and attention from supervisors, and it  frequently results in disciplinary action. You may control  employee/students attendance to reduce absenteeism.
